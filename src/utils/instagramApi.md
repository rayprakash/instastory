# Instagram API Integration Guide

## Overview

To integrate real Instagram API functionality, you'll need to set up a backend server. This is because:

1. Instagram's API requires authentication
2. API keys need to be kept secure (not in frontend code)
3. Rate limiting needs to be handled on the server

## Options for Instagram Integration

### Option 1: Official Instagram Graph API

- Requires a Facebook Developer account
- Requires a business/creator Instagram account
- Limited to approved apps with business requirements
- Not suitable for viewing other users' stories anonymously

### Option 2: Unofficial API (Not recommended for production)

- Uses reverse-engineered endpoints
- Against Instagram's Terms of Service
- High risk of being blocked/banned
- Frequently changes, requiring constant updates

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a backend API (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Set up proper authentication and security
3. Implement Instagram API calls on the server
4. Create endpoints for your frontend to call
5. Handle rate limiting, caching, and error scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Don't create a new Instagram account solely for API access** - Instagram may detect this as suspicious activity
2. Consider alternative solutions like embedding Instagram posts officially 
3. Be aware of Instagram's Terms of Service to avoid account restrictions

## Technical Integration (Backend Example - Node.js)

```javascript
// Example backend code (Node.js + Express)
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

// Secure storage for Instagram credentials/tokens
require('dotenv').config();

app.get('/api/instagram/stories/:username', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Use proper authentication methods 
    // Make API calls to Instagram
    // Return data to client
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error accessing Instagram API:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Error retrieving Instagram content');
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('API server running on port 3000'));
```

## Security Considerations

- Never expose Instagram API tokens in frontend code
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add proper authentication to your backend API
- Consider caching to reduce API calls to Instagram

Remember that accessing Instagram data without proper authorization may violate their Terms of Service.
